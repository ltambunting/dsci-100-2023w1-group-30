"Player Stats for Top 500 Players" on the Ultimate Tennis Statistics (UTS) website provides comprehensive statistical information about 
the top 500 professional tennis players in the world. These player statistics offer valuable insights into the performance, strengths, 
and weaknesses of these athletes. 
Problem: 1. What is the relationship between the age of tennis athletes an their best rankings? 
         2. Which country/athlete contains the best rank. 
         3. What is the relationship between the use of backhand and the best rank?
         4. Are the left-handed athletes get relatively higher average best ranks, or do the right-handed athletes?
         5. Is we are provided with a new observation which includes the country, backhand, play-hand, and age of the athlete, 
            what best-rank is most possibly be achieved by him/her?
Data set: Our data set has 501 rows and 6 columns which are chosen from the original 38 columns. The 6 columns are Age, 
Country, Plays, Name, BestRank, and Backhand, respectively. All of them will be used to complete the further classification and 
prediction problems.
